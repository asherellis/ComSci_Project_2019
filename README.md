# 2019 AP Compuer Sciece Animated Poetry Project 
#### The text that appears on the screen is part of a poem by Google's AI system. Here's the link to the poem: https://cutt.ly/8uScpg
#### It will be in the Google theme colors and in the Google font, Google Sans.
#### A few images will be displayed throughout the poem.
#### I also put some animations that reflect the mood of the lines of the poem (based on how I imagined it).

#### The main file for this project is AnimatedPoetry.pde
